## Stack 
A stack is a useful data structure in programming. It is just like a pile of plates kept on top of each other.

Think about the things you can do with such a pile of plates

Put a new plate on top
Remove the top plate

If you want the plate at the bottom, you have to first remove all the plates on top. 
Such kind of arrangement is called **Last In First Out** - the last item that was placed is the first item to go out.



## Stack Specification
A stack is an object or more specifically an abstract data structure(ADT) that allows the following operations:

Push: Add element to top of stack
Pop: Remove element from top of stack
IsEmpty: Check if stack is empty
IsFull: Check if stack is full
Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it

## How stack works
The operations work as follows:

A pointer called TOP is used to keep track of the top element in the stack.
When initializing the stack, we set its value to -1 so that we can check if the stack is empty by comparing TOP == -1.
On pushing an element, we increase the value of TOP and place the new element in the position pointed to by TOP.
On popping an element, we return the element pointed to by TOP and reduce its value.
Before pushing, we check if stack is already full
Before popping, we check if stack is already empty

## Use of stack
Although stack is a simple data structure to implement, it is very powerful. The most common uses of a stack are:
```
To reverse a word - Put all the letters in a stack and pop them out. Because of LIFO order of stack, you will get the letters in reverse order.
In compilers - Compilers use stack to calculate the value of expressions like 2+4/5*(7-9) by converting the expression to prefix or postfix form.
In browsers - The back button in a browser saves all the urls you have visited previously in a stack. Each time you visit a new page, it is added on top of the stack. When you press the back button, the current URL is removed from the stack and the previous url is accessed.
```
